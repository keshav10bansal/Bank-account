# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (Java)

**Development Timeline:** September 30 – October 15, 2025

This is a simple **Java console-based project** that simulates a basic bank system.  
I built it to practice **object-oriented programming, loops, arrays, and user input handling**.

## 💡 Features

- **Create New Account** – Enter name, account number, and opening balance  
- **Deposit Money** – Add funds to an account  
- **Withdraw Money** – Withdraw funds safely with validation  
- **View Account Details** – Check details for a specific account  
- **View All Accounts** – List all created accounts with current balances  
- **Exit Option** – Cleanly terminate the program  

Each operation is menu-driven and fully handled through the console, making it easy to understand and run.

- How to use **classes and objects** to represent real-world entities  
- Handling **arrays of objects** and looping through them efficiently  
- Writing **validation logic** for user inputs  
- Creating a **menu-based console application**
